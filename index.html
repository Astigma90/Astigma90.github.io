      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Adam. I work full time as a Linux Sysadmin with a focus on cyber security. I enjoy working with new technologies and learning new skills. I am motivated by novel experiences and curiosity.</p>
	  <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, listening to music, watching TV & films, playing games, and teaching myself new things. I'm fascinated with tech, nature and space.</p>
	  <p>Currently I am teaching myself HTML and Python. I don't fancy myself as a front end web developer but knowing the basics of HTML seems useful.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://github.com/astigma90/zoomender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zoomender</strong></a> - <i>is a Python web app I made to translate Gen Z / Zoomer slang into English</i></p>
	  <p><img src="./images/zoomender_screen.png" alt="Zoomender Web Page"/></p>
	  <p>While Zoomender started as a joke amongst colleagues I quickly got too invested in it and ended up taking a simple script that ran in the command line and turning it into a web app for anyone to use.</p>
